## **About This App**

We help dog lovers build a community around their dogs. A mobile first application developed with Handlebars, Node and MySQL. A user signs in, adds their dog and then it allows users to make posts to the group.
<br />
<br />
A crucial component of this app is the lost dog feature. Where a user is able to mark one the their dogs lost and provide a note which other can use in help finding the dog. The user's information is also published at this time under the Lost Dog page.

## **How to use this app**

## History

This app was originally created as the second of three projects for Northwestern's August Full Stack Bootcamp. We were assigned to a group of four people and were tasked to build the app which we wanted.
<br />
<br />
We set out to build an app to help those who love dogs build communitities and tap into them when crisis hits and they need help finding their beloved dog.

## Future Developments

The main next step for this app will be to take it from a handlebars app to an app developed with the MERN stack. There are many parts of this app, specifically the footer-navbar which would benefit from being a react component as well as having app level state with the user's information.
<br />
<br />
Features that will be added in the future are creating groups which are only visable to owners of specific breeds. Currently all users get all posts that were created. However, it was the original intention to create groups of people who owned specific breeds.
<br />
<br />
Additionally, the lost dog feature should sort dogs by nearest to your vicinity. We would do this with the zipcodes NPM package.
